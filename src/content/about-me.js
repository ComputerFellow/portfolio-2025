I then pursued tech graduate certificates at Conestoga and Seneca colleges, which furthered my understanding of secure web design and test-driven development. Currently, I am seeking opportunities to apply these skills and obtain an opportunity to support the front end of a leading organization."',

      '"My journey learning to code began in 2019. I was fascinated by computer scripts and characters I did not understand. Enrolling in <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.conestogac.on.ca/fulltime/computer-applications-development">Conestoga College</a>\'s Computer Application Development program, I set out to develop this understanding. The journey has been rewarding and hard but it\'s been worth it. I learned more about security in 2023 through Cybersecurity and Threat Management at       <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.senecapolytechnic.ca/programs/fulltime/CYT.html">Seneca College</a>. I consider myself a web and app developer focused on high-quality, thoroughly tested, and secure solutions, and I look forward to working with you on your organizational projects."',
