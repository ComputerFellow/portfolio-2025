      '"My journey learning to code began in 2019. I became captivated by computer scripts and characters I did not understand. My thirst for learning led me to enroll in Conestoga College\'s <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.conestogac.on.ca/fulltime/computer-applications-development"> Computer Application Development </a> program in 2020, and then <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.senecapolytechnic.ca/programs/fulltime/CYT.html"> Cybersecurity and Threat Management</a> with Seneca College in 2023. While not the straightforward process that I’d initially wanted, I have obtained the knowledge and skills needed for successful work. Presently, I continue to look for opportunities for partnership where my skills can be applied to maintain and strengthen company initiatives.”',
